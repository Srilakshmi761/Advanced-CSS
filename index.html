        <h2>Hello! I am Srilakshmi Yerasu</h2>
        <p>As a mother of two—an 11-year-old and a 4-year-old—raising them in different cultures and climates has come with its challenges.</p>
        <p>On top of that, I have been balancing the pursuit of a fulfilling career, learning new languages</p>
        <p>and working towards a degree, all while managing a full-time job.</p> 
        <p>It is been a tough but rewarding journey, and I did love to share my experiences with you all.</p>
